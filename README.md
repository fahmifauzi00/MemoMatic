2. **Transcription**: Audio is transcribed using Mesolitica's API
3. **Processing**: AI analyzes the transcript and extracts key information
4. **Generation**: Formatted minutes are generated with proper structure
5. **Download**: User can review and download the minutes as a DOCX file

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Mesolitica API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memomatic.git
cd memomatic
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
